# Digital Image Processing
This course was taken in the 4th term of the Bachelor of Information Systems program at UTFPR (Universidade Tecnológica Federal do Paraná).<br>
Here you can find the main topics covered in the course, as well as the college projects realized.
All of them were created using Python, focusing on OpenCV and NumPy libraries.

## Main topics studied
- Binarization by thresholding
- Blur
  - Mean Filter
  - Gaussian Filter
  - Integral Image
- Color spaces
  - RGB
  - HSL
- Bloom lighting
- Unsharp masking
- HDR and tone mapping
- Sobel algorithm
- Canny algorithm
- Otsu algorithm
- Hough transform
- Fourier transform
- JPEG
